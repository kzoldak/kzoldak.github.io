#### I will post useful machine learning tools here. These will mainly be in the Python and R languages. 

[Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/)

[Frequentism and Bayesianism IV: How to be a Bayesian in Python, by Jake VanderPlas](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/)

[Data Scientist Kevin Markham's Data School Webpage](https://www.dataschool.io/)
  There are a lot of useful links here, especially his [How to launch your data science career (with Python)](https://www.dataschool.io/launch-your-data-science-career-with-python/). This includes Jupyter notebooks for learning basics in python, pandas, and scikit-learn. He includes videos with each notebook; links are included within.

	
[__BOOK:__ The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/). You can download a PDF of the book on their site and following along with R Functions and Data they provide as well. 

[__BOOK:__ An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). Written by some of the same authors as ESL (above) and is more basic. Also provides a PDF of the book, R code for labs, and the data.
