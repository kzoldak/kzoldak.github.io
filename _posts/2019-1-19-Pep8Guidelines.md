title: Following the PEP 8 Style Guide 
---

The [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a document which provides guidelines for best practices when you are writting your Python code. I must admit, for most of my Python years I have been picking up coding habits, both good and bad, from reading other people's code. Sometimes I grab this code from popular Python packages, but most of the time it is code I grab off of Stack Overflow or random Github repositories. It highly depends on what the task at hand is. 

Now that I am transitioning from academia into the data science world, I am working harder to ensure my code follows these guidelines. This means I'll have to put down the excuse of, "I learned it off of another astrophysicist". 


I am forcing myself to no longer use the excuses like, "I learned them off of another astrophysicist".


closer instead of making up excuses for my poor habits, such as "I learned them off of another astrophysicist". 

I must admit, I have neglected my responsibilities a bit as a Python programmer. I have yet to read the PEP 8 Style Guidelines until very recently. I *always knew* there were good habits for writing clean and consistent code, but for many years I continued to trudge along picking up some good, but also many bad habits along my journey of self-taught Python programming skills.
