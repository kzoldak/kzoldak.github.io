These are my notes on the following paper: [Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4686.pdf).


# Linear Model
$$\begin{align} y=mx+b \end{align}$$

$$y=mx+b$$

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$




# Likelihood, $$\mathcal{L}$$
The likelihood is the frequencey distribution for the observables evaluated at the observed data, $$y_i$$. It is also (more commonly) referred to as "the likelihood of the parameters", eventhough it is a function of both the data and the model parameters. 



The likelihood of the parameters. Or, the frequencey distribution for the observables evaluated at the observed data $y_i$. The likelihood is a function of both the data and the model parameters.
