### I will post useful resources for Statistics at this page.


[Frequentism and Bayesianism IV: How to be a Bayesian in Python, by Jake VanderPlas](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/)

[Penn State Statistics Summer School (2015, year I attended)](http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su15/). There is a lot of useful presentations and R code to go along with them.
