### I will post useful python websites and blogs here.

## Python (General)
[Class Inheritance (in Python) Explained best by Jess Hamrick](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2011/05/18/an-introduction-to-classes-and-inheritance-in-python/)
[Python Data Camp Tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials)

## Data Science Specific Tools
[Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/)

[Data Scientist Kevin Markham's Data School Webpage](https://www.dataschool.io/)
  There are a lot of useful links here, especially his [How to launch your data science career (with Python)](https://www.dataschool.io/launch-your-data-science-career-with-python/). This includes Jupyter notebooks for learning basics in python, pandas, and scikit-learn. He includes videos with each notebook; links are included within.

[Frequentism and Bayesianism IV: How to be a Bayesian in Python, by Jake VanderPlas](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/)

[datacamp.com tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials). Once at this page, you can navigate the page and see all it has to offer. 

[__BOOK__:Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/)
and [his Github Page with content to go with it](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book). This guy was a creator of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), so clearly he rocks!!

## Pandas dataframes
[Brenda Hali's Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://towardsdatascience.com/my-pandas-cheat-sheet-b71437ab26f)

[PyData's Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

[Data Camp's Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-pandas-cheat-sheet)

## Plotting in Matplotlib
[Drop and Drag Text Example code, for moving text labels](http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Matplotlib_Drag_n_Drop_Text_Example.html)
--> This performed in iPython, must save image as .pdf, .ps, .eps, .cps because .png, .jpeg, and .tiff suffer resolution loss that can't be avoided (to my knowledge). Setting the dpi doesn't help.


## Numpy
[__BOOK__:Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney. Ch 4. NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/ch04.html)


## IPython
[Built-in Magic Commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). I find `%paste`, which pastes from the clipboard is the most useful tool when working in an ipython environment at my terminal.
