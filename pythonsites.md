[Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/)

[Frequentism and Bayesianism IV: How to be a Bayesian in Python, by Jake VanderPlas](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/)

[Data Scientist Kevin Markham's Data School Webpage](https://www.dataschool.io/)
  There are a lot of useful links here, especially his [How to launch your data science career (with Python)](https://www.dataschool.io/launch-your-data-science-career-with-python/). This includes Jupyter notebooks for learning basics in python, pandas, and scikit-learn. He includes videos with each notebook; links are included within.

--> This performed in iPython, must save image as .pdf, .ps, .eps, .cps because .png, .jpeg, and .tiff suffer resolution loss that can't be avoided (to my knowledge). Setting the dpi doesn't help.

[Class Inheritance Explained best by Jess Hamrick](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2011/05/18/an-introduction-to-classes-and-inheritance-in-python/)
